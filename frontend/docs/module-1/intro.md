# Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

Welcome to Module 1 of our Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook on ROS 2 for Physical AI and Humanoid Robots. This module introduces you to ROS 2 as the middleware that enables communication and control in humanoid robots, forming the foundation for Physical AI.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- Explain ROS 2's role in humanoid robotics
- Understand nodes, topics, and services
- Describe how Python agents connect via rclpy
- Read a basic humanoid URDF

## Target Audience

This module is designed for:
- AI students new to robotics
- Python developers entering Physical AI

## Prerequisites

Basic Python knowledge is recommended. Familiarity with distributed systems concepts will be helpful but is not required.

## Structure

This module consists of three chapters that progressively build your understanding:

1. [ROS 2 Foundations](./chapter-1-ros2-foundations.md) - Learn what ROS 2 is and why robots need middleware
2. [Nodes, Topics, and Services](./chapter-2-nodes-topics-services.md) - Understand the core communication patterns
3. [URDF for Humanoids](./chapter-3-urdf-humanoids.md) - Discover how to represent humanoid robots

The content uses the nervous-system analogy throughout to make complex concepts more accessible. We'll focus on conceptual understanding with practical examples that bridge from Python knowledge to ROS 2.
