# Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)

Welcome to Module 2 of our AI-Spec Driven Technical Book on simulation for Physical AI and Humanoid Robots. This module introduces you to physics simulation and environment building for humanoid robots, bridging digital models and real-world behavior.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- Understand physics simulation in Gazebo
- Simulate sensors (LiDAR, Depth Cameras, IMUs)
- Build basic virtual environments in Unity for humanoid interaction

## Target Audience

This module is designed for:
- Students familiar with Python and ROS 2
- AI learners entering simulation environments

## Prerequisites

This module assumes you have:
- Basic knowledge of Python programming
- Understanding of ROS 2 concepts (covered in Module 1)
- Familiarity with robotics fundamentals

## Structure

This module consists of three chapters that progressively build your understanding of digital twin simulation:

1. [Gazebo Basics](./chapter-1-gazebo-basics.md) - Learn physics, gravity, collisions, and virtual robot control
2. [Sensor Simulation](./chapter-2-sensor-simulation.md) - Understand how sensors are simulated in virtual environments
3. [Unity Virtual Environments](./chapter-3-unity-virtual-environments.md) - Discover how to create environments for humanoid interaction

The content focuses on conceptual understanding without requiring complex installation procedures or advanced scripting, building on your existing Python and ROS 2 knowledge.
