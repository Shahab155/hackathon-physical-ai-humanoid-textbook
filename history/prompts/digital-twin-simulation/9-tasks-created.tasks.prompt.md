# Prompt History Record

## Outcome
Successfully created comprehensive task list for implementing Module 2 - The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity), organizing development work by user story priority with proper dependencies and parallel execution opportunities.

## Evaluation
Tasks follow the required format with sequential IDs, proper story labeling, and specific file paths. Organized in phases from setup through foundational to user stories in priority order (P1, P2, P3), concluding with polish phase. Each user story is structured to be independently implementable and testable, following the constitutional principles of spec-driven development and production-ready documentation.

## Prompt Text
```

```

## Response Text
Generated comprehensive task list (tasks.md) with 38 specific tasks organized across 6 phases:

1. Phase 1: Setup (4 tasks) - Docusaurus project structure for module 2
2. Phase 2: Foundational (3 tasks) - Core documentation infrastructure
3. Phase 3: User Story 1 (8 tasks) - Gazebo physics simulation fundamentals
4. Phase 4: User Story 2 (8 tasks) - Sensor simulation concepts
5. Phase 5: User Story 3 (7 tasks) - Unity virtual environments
6. Phase 6: Polish (7 tasks) - Cross-cutting improvements and validation

Tasks follow required format with [ID] [P?] [Story] labels and specific file paths. Includes parallel execution opportunities and dependencies tracking. Each user story maintains independence while building on foundational concepts.
