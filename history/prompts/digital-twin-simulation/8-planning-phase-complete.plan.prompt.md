# Prompt History Record

## Outcome
Successfully completed planning phase for Module 2 - The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity), including technical architecture, research, data modeling, and quickstart guide.

## Evaluation
Planning phase delivered all required artifacts: implementation plan with technical context, research findings addressing all unknowns, data model for the educational content, quickstart guide for development setup, and contracts directory. All constitutional checks passed, ensuring alignment with project principles.

## Prompt Text
```

```

## Response Text
Completed the planning phase for the Digital Twin simulation module with the following deliverables:

1. Implementation Plan (plan.md): Outlined technical approach using Docusaurus framework with proper project structure
2. Research Document (research.md): Resolved all technical questions and established best practices for educational content about simulation
3. Data Model (data-model.md): Defined content entities and relationships for the educational module
4. Quickstart Guide (quickstart.md): Provided setup instructions and development workflow
5. Contracts Directory: Created placeholder for any interface definitions

All constitutional principles were validated, including spec-driven development, Docusaurus-centric architecture, and production-ready documentation requirements. The plan sets up proper directory structure for the three-module chapter organization covering Gazebo physics, sensor simulation, and Unity environments.
